#Craigsdiff
Track changes to listings on Craigslist

Chrome extension that enables users to track and observe changes to listings on Craigslist.

The javascript library that detects changes utilizes google's diff_match_patch in character mode. The changes are stored
in localStorage as nonstandard patches that utilize less space than those generated by diff_match_patch (and are generated as
a transformation of unified foratted diffs)

This extension does not utilize any third-party libraries aside from google's [diff_match_patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/)

To get a feel for how the extension works (without having to install it first), you can try it out on a mockup of craigslist [HERE](http://clmockup.herokuapp.com)
